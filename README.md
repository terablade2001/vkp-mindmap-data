# About
This project consists of a set of Mind-Map files created with [SimpleMind Pro](https://simplemind.eu/), containing personal highlights and notes from books, audibles and other sources that I've personally read/listen/seen and want keep for online access and for sharing with others. The notes may not represent the actual content of the sources I've seen, and may not contain coherent information without the original sources, thus readers are always welcomed to seek access to the original sources which are provided via links in the mind-maps.

The contents of this repository are exported to HTML pages through SimpleMind Pro and are also available as static pages at:
https://vkp-mindmap-data.netlify.app/

For those who are interested for interactivity, they can directly use the .smmx files through the SimpleMind's [viewer-only](https://simplemind.eu/download/simplemind-viewer/) or [full-edition](https://simplemind.eu/download/full-edition/) software.
